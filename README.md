# CompilerDesign

 Tech Stack: SLY, Python
 • Successfully developed a minimal C compiler, implementing core functionalities to process and compile C-like code.
• Designed and implemented a lexer to tokenize source code, supporting a subset of C syntax, and created a parser to 
build a syntax tree ensuring syntactic correctness. Constructed an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the structure 
of parsed code, aiding subsequent compilation stages.
